Product Requirements Document (PRD) for WinPulse
1. Overview
Product Name
WinPulse
Product Description
WinPulse is a lightweight, open-source Windows customization utility that serves as a modular hub for enhancing user control over the OS. It integrates a wide variety of features inspired by tools like PowerToys, FancyZones, Windhawk, Winaero Tweaker, and Ditto, but with a focus on low resource usage, toggleable modules, and deep customization. Users can enable/disable features on-demand to avoid background bloat, ensuring the app runs efficiently (<20MB RAM idle, <50MB with 3-4 modules active). The app empowers users by providing tools across categories like window management, UI tweaks, hotkeys, performance optimization, and clipboard/file management, all in one place—no need for multiple apps.

Goals and Objectives

Primary Goal: Create a user-centric, low-resource alternative to PowerToys that covers diverse use cases (productivity, creativity, gaming, maintenance) through modular features.
Key Objectives:

Achieve ultra-low resource footprint to run smoothly on mid-range hardware (e.g., Asus Vivobook).
Provide toggleable modules for customization, ensuring no unwanted processes.
Support open-source contributions for community-driven expansions.
Enhance user satisfaction by putting them "at ease" through control and efficiency (e.g., quick tweaks without system drag).
Build a portfolio-worthy project for career growth (e.g., resume booster for IT roles in DevOps, full-stack, or AI/ML).


Success Metrics: 100+ GitHub stars in first month, user feedback on resource savings, bug-free MVP with all features implemented.

Target Audience

Power Users/Developers: Need window splitting, hotkeys, and automation for workflows (e.g., VS Code multitasking).
Students: Quick clipboard history, UI tweaks for focused study sessions.
Gamers: Performance optimizers to kill RAM hogs for smooth play.
Creatives: UI enhancers for aesthetic desktops.
General Users: Anyone frustrated by Windows defaults or heavy tools, seeking a lightweight hub.

Assumptions and Constraints

Platform: Windows 10/11 (primary); cross-platform later.
Tech Stack: Rust + Tauri for low overhead (or C# + WPF as alt).
Constraints: No external dependencies beyond core libs; admin rights for some tweaks (prompt user); test on mid-range hardware.
Assumptions: Users have basic tech literacy; open-source under MIT license.

2. Features
Features are organized by category for clarity, as discussed. Each is a toggleable module (DLL/WASM) loaded only when enabled via the dashboard. Include per-feature settings (e.g., hotkeys, sliders) stored in JSON config. All features must be implemented without fail, starting with MVP picks (marked *) and expanding in future releases.
2.1 Window Management Tools

Testing: Unit tests (Rust's built-in), benchmarks vs. PowerToys.
Deployment: GitHub Releases (.exe/MSI); auto-updates later.

5. Roadmap

MVP (v1.0): Implement all * features (5 modules, one per category). Launch in 4 weeks.
v1.1: Add remaining features; community PRs.
