## 1. Overview

Product Name: WinPulse

Product Description  
WinPulse is a lightweight, open-source Windows customization utility that serves as a modular hub for enhancing user control over the OS. It integrates a wide variety of features inspired by tools like PowerToys, Rainmeter, Ditto and other small utilities to provide productivity, customization and performance tools in a single, low-overhead package.

Primary Goal: Create a user-centric, low-resource alternative to PowerToys that covers diverse use cases (productivity, creativity, gaming, maintenance) through modular features.

Key Objectives:
- Achieve an ultra-low resource footprint to run smoothly on mid-range hardware (e.g., Asus Vivobook).
- Provide toggleable modules for customization, ensuring no unwanted background processes.
- Support open-source contributions for community-driven expansions.
- Enhance user satisfaction by putting them "at ease" through control and efficiency (quick tweaks without system drag).
- Build a portfolio-worthy project for career growth (resume booster for IT roles in DevOps, full-stack, or AI/ML).

Success Metrics:
- 100+ GitHub stars in the first month.
- Positive user feedback on resource savings.
- Bug-free MVP with all core features implemented.

---

## Target Audience
- Power Users / Developers: Need window splitting, hotkeys, and automation for workflows (e.g., VS Code multitasking).
- Students: Quick clipboard history, UI tweaks for focused study sessions.
- Gamers: Performance optimizers to suspend or kill RAM hogs for smoother play.
- Creatives: UI enhancers for aesthetic desktops and workflow improvements.
- General Users: Anyone frustrated by Windows defaults or heavy tools, seeking a lightweight hub.

---

## Assumptions and Constraints
- Platform: Windows 10/11 (primary). Cross-platform support planned for later versions.
- Tech Stack: Rust + Tauri for low overhead (C# + WPF as an alternative if needed).
- Constraints: Minimize external dependencies; some tweaks will require admin rights (prompt user).
- Assumptions: Users have basic technical literacy.
- Storage & License: Config stored in %APPDATA%/WinPulse and project released under MIT license.

## 2. Features

All features are modular and toggleable. Each is implemented as a module (DLL/WASM) loaded only when enabled via the dashboard. Per-feature settings (hotkeys, sliders) are available in the dashboard.

  - Requirements: Gesture drawing (e.g., circle => search), macro recording.  
  - Customization: Button mappings, sensitivity sliders.

- Key Remapper  
  - Capabilities: Global and per-app shortcuts, conflict detection.  
  - Requirements: Exportable profiles, integration with other modules.  
  - Customization: Binder UI, optional script editor (Lua).

- Quick Launcher  
  - Capabilities: Hotkey-triggered search for apps/files with plugin support.  
  - Requirements: Workflow actions (URL handling, commands).  
  - Customization: Plugin ecosystem for community extensions.

### 2.4 Performance Optimization Tools
Focus: System health and efficiency. Inspired by O&O ShutUp10, WizTree.

- **Process Controller (MVP)**  
  - Capabilities: Monitor, suspend or kill resource hogs; startup manager.  
  - Requirements: Real-time graphs, alerts for thresholds.  
  - Customization: Threshold sliders, whitelists.

- Modules: Implemented as dynamically-loadable modules (DLLs or WASM). Event-driven hooks via windows-rs, enigo, or equivalent libraries.
- Storage: JSON configuration stored in %APPDATA%/WinPulse (e.g., `%APPDATA%\\WinPulse\\config.json`).
- Testing: Unit tests (Rust built-in), integration tests on Windows 10/11, performance benchmarks compared vs. alternatives (PowerToys).
- Deployment: GitHub Releases with installers (.exe / .msi). Auto-update support planned for future releases.

---

## 5. Roadmap

- MVP (v1.0): Implement all starred (*) MVP features — one core feature per category (5 modules). Target launch: 4 weeks from project start.
- v1.1: Add remaining planned features and consolidate community PRs.
- Future: Cross-platform support, public API for extensions, and a mobile companion app.

---

## 6. Risks and Mitigations

- Risk: Scope creep  
  - Mitigation: Enforce MVP scope; treat PRD as the source of truth. Prioritize features and schedule additional items for later releases.
- Risk: Resource bloat  
  - Mitigation: Profile each module; set strict memory and CPU budgets for modules.
- Risk: WinAPI quirks and compatibility issues  
  - Mitigation: Test on multiple Windows versions and VM images; maintain a compatibility matrix and automated tests.
